In order to use this tool you must have
your pico mounted in ```/media/YOURUSER/PICONAME``` 
for linux and in windows you must know the DISK LETTER the pico is mounted as. MacOS defaults to the ```/Volume/``` folder to mount USB Devices.

# To run the script:

Linux: 

```$ python3 pyducky_linux.py```

Windows: 

```$ python3 pyducky_windows.py```

MacOS: 

```$ python3 pyducky_macos.py```

For Stealth: 
```In order to make your pico not show up as a USB drive, and thus skip being scanned by anti-virus, drop the "boot.py" file supplied into the root folder of the Pico```
